# MindMeld: Neural Consensus Protocol

![MindMeld Logo](./assets/mindmeld-logo.png)

## Overview
MindMeld is a groundbreaking protocol that enables multiple AI models to reach consensus on complex decisions through a neural voting mechanism, all executed onchain. This creates the first truly decentralized AI decision-making system where no single model has complete authority.

Built for the Sonic Hackathon 2024, MindMeld demonstrates how AI can be brought onchain to enhance efficiency, decision-making, and coordination in decentralized systems.

## Key Features

- **Neural Consensus Mechanism**: AI models contribute their outputs as weighted neural patterns that form a combined decision matrix
- **Decision Proof System**: Cryptographic proofs of AI decisions with full auditability
- **Cross-Model Learning**: Models improve collectively through federated learning
- **Decision NFTs**: Unique tokens representing significant decisions with their context and outcome

## Architecture

MindMeld consists of four main components:

1. **AI Models Layer**: Interface with various AI models to collect their outputs
2. **Neural Aggregation Layer**: Combines outputs using tensor consensus algorithms
3. **Consensus Protocol Layer**: Validates and weights model contributions
4. **Output Layer**: Generates Decision NFTs and final outcomes
